# Math Utilities

A Set of Math Functions to make my life (and the people who use this lives') easier.

## Why?

Two reasons.

1. I get bored of my current projects sometimes.
  2. I showed my Calculus teacher my [https://github.com/ValiantWind/Calculators](Calculators Project) and he was impressed about the fact that I'm trying to make a website for several types of Calculators.
    - He asked if I could make a set of functions and tools that could help with general math equations and formulas and such, and that if I managed to do this, he'd give me extra credit. That's very cool of him.

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome. It will save me from using hours of my time for making functions for complicated formulas. 

## FAQ

Q: Some of these functions are a waste of time to make, since you only need one line to replicate it. Why bother to make these?

A: See Reason 2 from above

Q: Do you plan on maintaining this after you show your Calculus teacher this project?

A: Probably.

Q: Will you ever publish this to NPM?

A: Probably not, since there are much better packages out there that people can use instead of mine.
